# Refined_porfolio

# Purpose: 
The purpose of this assignment was to take the original portfolio we built in assignment two and refine it, making sure to add all of our past assignments onto the portfolio page and that there is a downloadable resume available. By making the webpage more presentable we were able to take what was originally a roughshod first attempt at manipulating css and html and make a portfolio website that we could actually be proud of; a page potential employers could view and see our capabilities. We were also instructed to update our github and linkedin pages. 

# Process 
* First I downloaded my old portfolio into a new repo.
* Then I went and edited all of the noticable grammar mistakes that I had unknowingly left from that previous version. 
* From there I added a download link for the resume onto each of the different html nav bars
* Then I took screenshots of all previous assignments, added a link to both its github repo and the deployed website, and placed it within the portfolio html, getting rid of the previous images I was using as a placeholder. 
* Then I edited the margins and dimensions of the portfolio cards so that there was no overlap during any screensize changes. 
* From there I went and updated my contacts page, adding my email, phone number, github profile and linkedin profile so that potential employers could reach out and contact me. 
* I then went and changed the color scheme of my portfolio to make it more presentable and also match the theme that I had been replicating in previous assignments (when speaking to a UX designer they said this was something that a lot of experienced developers did so as to leave a kind of calling card).
* I then designed and placed a unique logo for my brand in the nav bar to make my products immediately recognizable. 
* Finally, I went and updated my github profile and linkedin profile attract potential employers. 

# Issue I ran across:
* Fixing the margins of the portfolio cards so that they wouldn't overlap during certain screen sizes. This took a lot of trial and error to get it right.
